    "Type 2 Diabetes": `Type 2 Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency. The genetic analysis reveals susceptibility markers associated with impaired glucose metabolism, pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction, and insulin signaling pathways.

KEY FINDINGS:
• Genetic markers in TCF7L2 gene (Like : rs7903146, rs12255372)
• Insulin receptor substrate (IRS1) polymorphisms
• GLUT2 glucose transporter variants
• Adiponectin (ADIPOQ) gene variants

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
• Increased risk of insulin resistance
• Potential for early onset metabolic syndrome
• Higher likelihood of microvascular complications
• Important considerations for lifestyle interventions

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS:
• Regular glucose monitoring
• Lifestyle modification programs
• Consider early pharmacological intervention
• Annual screening for complications

GENETIC RISK SCORE: Based on analysis of 65 susceptibility loci, the polygenic risk score indicates a 3.2-fold increased risk compared to population average.`,

    "Glaucoma": `Glaucoma is a group of eye conditions that damage the optic nerve, often associated with elevated intraocular pressure and progressive vision loss.

KEY GENETIC MARKERS:
• MYOC gene mutations (myocilin)
• OPTN gene variants (optineurin)
• CYP1B1 cytochrome P450 mutations
• WDR36 gene polymorphisms

CLINICAL FEATURES:
• Progressive optic nerve damage
• Visual field defects
• Elevated intraocular pressure
• Optic disc cupping

RISK ASSESSMENT:
• Genetic predisposition accounts for 30-50% of cases
• Family history significantly increases risk
• Early screening recommended for at-risk individuals

MONITORING PROTOCOL:
• Annual comprehensive eye exams
• Regular intraocular pressure measurements
• Visual field testing every 6-12 months
• Optic nerve head imaging

DISEASE PROGRESSION: Without intervention, gradual peripheral vision loss leading to tunnel vision and potential blindness.`,

    "Glioma": `Glioma is a type of tumor that occurs in the brain and spinal cord, originating from glial cells. Gliomas can be classified by cell type, grade, and location.

GENETIC RISK FACTORS:
• IDH1/IDH2 mutations (isocitrate dehydrogenase)
• TP53 tumor suppressor gene mutations
• EGFR amplification
• TERT promoter mutations
• 1p/19q co-deletion in oligodendrogliomas

CLINICAL PRESENTATION:
• Headaches (often worse in morning)
• Seizures
• Cognitive changes
• Focal neurological deficits

RISK STRATIFICATION:
• High-grade gliomas (GBM) have poor prognosis
• Low-grade gliomas may progress slowly
• Genetic markers influence treatment response

MANAGEMENT APPROACH:
• Regular neurological assessments
• MRI surveillance every 3-6 months
• Consideration of genetic testing for treatment planning
• Multidisciplinary tumor board review

SURVIVAL RATES: 5-year survival varies from 95% for grade I to 5% for grade IV glioblastoma.`,

    "Non-glioblastoma glioma": `Non-glioblastoma glioma represents a spectrum of brain tumors originating from glial cells, excluding the most aggressive form (glioblastoma multiforme).

KEY GENETIC FEATURES:
• IDH1/IDH2 mutations present in 70-80% of cases
• TP53 mutations common in astrocytomas
• 1p/19q co-deletion characteristic of oligodendrogliomas
• ATRX loss in astrocytic tumors

CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS:
• Generally better prognosis than glioblastoma
• Variable growth rates and malignant potential
• May remain stable for extended periods
• Potential for malignant transformation

DIAGNOSTIC WORKUP:
• MRI with contrast enhancement
• Molecular profiling essential for classification
• WHO CNS5 classification incorporates molecular markers
• Regular surveillance imaging

TREATMENT CONSIDERATIONS:
• Maximal safe surgical resection
• Radiation therapy for high-grade tumors
• Chemotherapy (TMZ, PCV regimen)
• Long-term follow-up with neuroimaging

PROGNOSTIC FACTORS: Age, performance status, tumor grade, and molecular markers significantly impact outcomes.`,

PROGNOSTIC FACTORS: Age, performance status, tumor grade, and molecular markers significantly impact outcomes.`,

    "Endometriosis": `Endometriosis is a condition where tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterine cavity, causing pain and infertility.

GENETIC ASSOCIATIONS:
• WNT4 gene variants
• VEZT gene polymorphisms
• Chromosome 7p15.2 region
• GREB1 gene expression changes

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS:
• Chronic pelvic pain
• Dysmenorrhea (painful periods)
• Dyspareunia (painful intercourse)
• Infertility
• Gastrointestinal symptoms during menstruation

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY:
• Estrogen-dependent inflammatory condition
• Impaired immune clearance of endometrial cells
• Angiogenesis and nerve growth factor upregulation

TREATMENT CONSIDERATIONS:
• Hormonal suppression therapy
• Pain management strategies
• Surgical intervention for advanced cases
• Fertility preservation counseling

PREVALENCE: Affects approximately 10% of reproductive-aged women worldwide.`,

    "Suicide": `Suicidal behavior is a complex multifactorial condition influenced by genetic predisposition, environmental factors, and psychological stressors.

GENETIC RISK MARKERS:
• SLC6A4 serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR)
